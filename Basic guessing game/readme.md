<h1>Basic number guessing game<h1>

<p>This is a simple Python guessing game using basic python keywords.<p>
<h1>I learnt this course from Coursera, so I thank them.<h1>

<h1>The program will first ask for your input by asking your name, which you will respond by stating your name. 
After this, the program will greet you and then tell you whether you would like to begin the guessing game. (You can't say no)
Then you will be asked to guess a number between 0 to 20 which you have to guess in less than 6 guesses.
Every assumption you make, the program will announce if you are higher or lower to the number.
If you guess correctly within 6 guesses, then congratulations! You win! If you don't, well... You lose! The program will display the number you were supposed to predict, if you lose.<h1>

<h1>The program works on an algorithm which is in the library called "random" which is imported using import keyword. 
No graphics are needed, all you need is any version of Python 3 or above. You can run this program in Python IDLE itself or any IDE you prefer. <h1>

<h1>Hope you enjoy this simple project! :)<h1>
