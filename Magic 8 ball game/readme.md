<h1>Magic 8 Ball<h1>

<p>Learnt from the book "Automate the boring stuff with python" by Al Sweigart.<p>

<p>Another simple game where you ask a question and the code randomises a set of specific answers which is implemented using lists amd the library "random".<p>
<p>All you have to do is run the file in your Python IDLE or IDE. (Note: You need Python 3 or above).<p>
<p>Ask your question and let the code decide your fate.<p>

<p>Have fun with it!<p>
